## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please use one of these channels:

1. Preferred: GitHub **Private vulnerability reporting** (Security tab).

When reporting, include:

- Affected path(s)/project(s)
- Steps to reproduce

- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if available)

## Disclosure Process

- We acknowledge reports as quickly as possible.
- We validate and patch in the default branch.
- We avoid publishing exploit details before a fix is available.
